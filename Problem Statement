Project Name = (RetailHub CRM – Customer Loyalty & Inventory System)

Problem Statement ->


A retail chain is facing challenges in managing customer engagement across both walk-in stores
and online platforms. Currently, customer purchases are recorded in separate systems, and loyalty
program points are tracked manually, leading to errors and dissatisfaction. Inventory shortages
often result in lost sales, and managers cannot view real-time reports on sales performance,
inventory status, or loyalty program effectiveness. Sales representatives also lack insights into
high-value customers, which limits their ability to deliver personalized offers.
This fragmented process results in inefficient operations, poor customer satisfaction, and reduced
sales growth. The proposed solution is to implement a Salesforce-based CRM system—RetailHub
CRM—to centralize customer data, automate loyalty program tracking, and provide real-time
inventory and reporting capabilities.

Future Plan ->


The RetailHub CRM project will be implemented in multiple phases:
1. Requirement Analysis & Stakeholder Mapping – Understand challenges faced by managers,
sales reps, and customers.
2. Salesforce Org Setup – Configure users, roles, profiles, and company settings.
3. Data Modeling – Create objects for Customers, Products, Purchases, and Loyalty Transactions.
4. Process Automation – Automate loyalty point calculations, inventory alerts, and customer
notifications.
5. Apex Development – Implement triggers and classes for advanced logic such as personalized
recommendations and batch processing.
6. Lightning Components – Build LWC dashboards for sales reps and managers.
7. Integration – Connect with e-commerce website for online sales and external APIs for
notifications.
8. Deployment & Testing – Migrate from sandbox to production with test classes and QA.
9. Reporting & Dashboards – Provide insights into sales performance, inventory levels, and loyalty
program effectiveness.
10. Final Demo & Documentation – Present results, feedback collection, and project handover.
